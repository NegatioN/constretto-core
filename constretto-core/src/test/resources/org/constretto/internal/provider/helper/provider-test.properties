base.child.key1=base.child.key1-value
base.child.key2=base.child.key2-value
base.child.key3=base.child.key3-value

@some-tag.base.child.key1=base.child.key1-value for some-tag
@some-tag.base.child.key2=base.child.key2-value for some-tag
@some-tag.base.child.key3=base.child.key3-value for some-tag

#
# Used for testing that properites with no default tag
# are only available in mathing runtime tag configurations

@development.ionlyexistindevelopment=I only exist in development

#
# Used for testing variable resolving
#
start-value=used
middle-value=middle
end-value=end

at-start=${start-value} at the beginning it works
at-end=it works when its at the ${end-value}
in-the-middle=when used in the ${middle-value}, it also works
multiple-replacements=${start-value) at the beginning and in the ${middle-value}. It also works
circular=but when used in a ${circular}. It better throw an exception before giving a stack overflow :)

#
# Used for testing that variable resolving works well together
# with the taggin concept
